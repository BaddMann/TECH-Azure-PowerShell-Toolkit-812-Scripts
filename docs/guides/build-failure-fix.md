# Build Failure Fix Guide This document outlines the two build failures in your Azure Enterprise Toolkit project and their solutions. ## Issue 1: PowerShell CI Failure [NON-COMPLIANT] **Problem:** PSScriptAnalyzer found parse errors in `Azure-Resource-Tagger-Pro.ps1` **Root Cause:** Using the `++` operator on variables accessed through `$using:` scope in parallel execution blocks is invalid PowerShell syntax. **Location:** Lines 93 and 96 in the parallel execution block: ```powershell $using:successCount++ # [NON-COMPLIANT] Invalid syntax $using:errorCount++ # [NON-COMPLIANT] Invalid syntax ``` **Solution:** [COMPLIANT] **FIXED** The script has been updated to collect results from parallel execution and count them afterward: ```powershell # Before (invalid) $using:successCount++ # After (fixed) $results = $operations | ForEach-Object -Parallel { # Return success/failure objects return @{ Success = $true; ResourceName = $_.Resource.Name } } -ThrottleLimit 10 # Count results $successCount = ($results | Where-Object { $_.Success }).Count $errorCount = ($results | Where-Object { -not $_.Success }).Count ``` ## Issue 2: Jekyll Build Failure (Git Submodule) [NON-COMPLIANT] **Problem:** Jekyll build fails with "No url found for submodule path 'bookmarks' in .gitmodules" **Root Cause:** The `bookmarks` directory was previously configured as a git submodule, but the `.gitmodules` file is missing or the submodule wasn't properly configured. **Solution:** **READY TO FIX** Run the provided script to convert the submodule to a regular directory: ```powershell # Execute the fix script .\fixes\fix-bookmarks-submodule.ps1 ``` **Manual Steps (if script fails):** ```bash # 1. Remove submodule reference from git index git rm --cached bookmarks # 2. Add bookmarks as regular directory git add bookmarks/ # 3. Commit the changes git commit -m "Convert bookmarks from submodule to regular directory" # 4. Push changes git push origin main ``` ## Additional PowerShell Issues Found The PSScriptAnalyzer also found numerous other warnings that should be addressed for code quality: ### Critical Issues: - **PSUseShouldProcessForStateChangingFunctions:** Many functions that change system state don't support `-WhatIf` - **PSUseSingularNouns:** Several cmdlets use plural nouns instead of singular - **PSUseDeclaredVarsMoreThanAssignments:** Variables assigned but never used - **PSAvoidUsingPositionalParameters:** Using positional parameters instead of named parameters ### Recommendations: 1. **Add ShouldProcess support** to functions that change system state 2. **Rename cmdlets** to use singular nouns (e.g., `New-ModernDataPipeline` instead of `New-ModernDataPipelines`) 3. **Remove unused variables** or use them appropriately 4. **Use named parameters** instead of positional parameters for better readability ## Next Steps 1. [COMPLIANT] **PowerShell syntax error** - Fixed automatically 2. **Run the bookmarks fix script** - Execute `.\fixes\fix-bookmarks-submodule.ps1` 3. **Test the builds** - Push changes and verify both CI pipelines pass 4. **Address remaining warnings** - Consider fixing the PSScriptAnalyzer warnings for better code quality ## Files Modified - `automation-scripts/General-Utilities/Azure-Resource-Tagger-Pro.ps1` - Fixed parallel execution syntax - `fixes/fix-bookmarks-submodule.ps1` - Script to fix git submodule issue After applying these fixes, both build pipelines should pass successfully!
